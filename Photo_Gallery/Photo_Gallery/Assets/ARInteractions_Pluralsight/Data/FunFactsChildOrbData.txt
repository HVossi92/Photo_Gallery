The Kingdom of Navarre

In 1265, San Sebastian was given to the King of Navarre as part of a wedding dowry. This gave the kingdom a much-needed seaport, and soon trade flourished with Gascony and other European ports. The main exports were various Castilian products, along with whaling related goods and cod caught by local fishermen.

A City of Sculptures

Many artists developed a strong relationship with the basque city of San Sebastian-Donostia throughout it's history. Artists such as Eduardo Chillida and Jorge Oteiza have left their mark on the city with numerous grand sculptures. Pictured is "Construcción Vacía" or "Empty Construction" by Jorge Oteiza.
