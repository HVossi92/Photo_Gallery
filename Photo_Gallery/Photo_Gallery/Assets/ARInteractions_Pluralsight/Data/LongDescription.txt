The city’s abrupt military history remains alive on Monte Urgull. The setting and terrain of the hill led to its use in the 12th century as a military fortress, sole witness to the numerous attacks and sieges suffered by the walls of San Sebastián down through the years. Part of these walls can still be seen in the Boulevard underground car park. In 1794, Monte Urgull witnessed the first capitulation of the city into French hands and looked on, powerless, as fire from the battle between French troops and the Anglo-Portuguese army razed the city to the ground in 1813.

The 12th century Castillo de la Mota standing at the top of the hill was key in defending the city, and around it you can still see the canons and arrow slits used to defend it. It is also home to the Casa de la Historia, where you can learn about the city history. The English Cemetery, opened in 1924 and standing on the north face of the hill, testifies to the stay in San Sebastián by the English during the 1st Carlist War (1833-1840).
